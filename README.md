## SilentDragon (SD)

Type: Full Node GUI Wallet

Both SD+SDL use QT5 as a GUI library, and so we use QT Linguist to do translations. To see all the current
translations for SD on Github, look for all the `silentdragon_*.ts` files here:

https://github.com/MyHush/SilentDragon/tree/master/res

These files are XML. For example, the Russian translation file for SD is here:

https://github.com/MyHush/SilentDragon/blob/master/res/silentdragon_ru.ts

There is currently a 500 HUSH bounty to add a new language to SD.

## SilentDragonLite (SDL) 

Type: Lite Node GUI Wallet

All translations are here in the `silentdragonlite_*.ts` file https://github.com/MyHush/SilentDragonLite/tree/master/res

For example, the French SDL translation https://github.com/MyHush/SilentDragonLite/blob/master/res/silentdragonlite_fr.ts

There is currently a 500 HUSH bounty to add a new language to SDL.
