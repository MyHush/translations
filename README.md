# Hush Translations

The Hush project welcomes people of all languages to contribute translations, to make Hush accessible to people all around
the world. 

All usernames and channels mentioned in this document refer to Hush Discord at https://myhush.org/discord

Please join #translations to ask questions about this document or helping.

## Rules

We now have more rules:

 * Translator can be completely anonymous, we don't need your government ID
 * Translators can work on one single wallet or reserve all three wallets (SD,SDL,SDA)
 * Reservations are for two weeks and then that item will go back to the available pool of translations.
 * Translator must be a native speaker (spoken the language since childhood)
 * Translator must be the person who receives the bounty (no middle-people)
 * Translator must create and receive the bounty to a shielded address (zaddr)
 * A "broker" may help find native speakers and work out a fair % of the fee, for the translator to pay them, upon completion. The broker may not take payment.
 
 Additionally, here are some rules about the content of the translations:
 
 * Please submit files in .txt or .xml format, not RTF/PDF/DOCX/etc
 * Submitting a PR to Github `dev` branch is easiest for devs, but uploading to Discord is also fine
 * Please put the 2 or 3 letter language code in the name of the file (like ES for Spanish or ZH for Chinese)

 

## SilentDragon (SD)

Type: Full Node GUI Wallet

Both SD+SDL use QT5 as a GUI library, and so we use QT Linguist to do translations. To see all the current
translations for SD on Github, look for all the `silentdragon_*.ts` files here:

https://github.com/MyHush/SilentDragon/tree/master/res

These files are XML. For example, the Russian translation file for SD is here:

https://github.com/MyHush/SilentDragon/blob/master/res/silentdragon_ru.ts

There is currently a 500 HUSH bounty to add a new language to SD.

## SilentDragonLite (SDL) 

Type: Lite Node GUI Wallet

All translations are here in the `silentdragonlite_*.ts` file https://github.com/MyHush/SilentDragonLite/tree/master/res

For example, the French SDL translation https://github.com/MyHush/SilentDragonLite/blob/master/res/silentdragonlite_fr.ts

There is currently a 500 HUSH bounty to add a new language to SDL.

## SilentDragonAndroid (SDA)

Type: Android GUI Wallet that connects to SD or SDL

Currently 125 HUSH bounty per language
